# rtask - A Simple Task Management Tool

rtask is a simple tool to manage your tasks. The primary target is the
command line, but more sophisticated interfaces are planned as well.

Many features were inspired by [TaskWarrior](https://taskwarrior.org)
which is a great tool but doesn't exactly fits my needs.
